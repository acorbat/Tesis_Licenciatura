@article{Rehm2009,
abstract = {Individual cells within a population undergo apoptosis at distinct, apparently random time points. By analyzing cellular mitotic history, we identified that sibling HeLa cell pairs, in contrast to random cell pairs, underwent apoptosis synchronously. This allowed us to use high-speed cellular imaging to investigate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a highly coordinated, rapid process during apoptosis, at a temporal resolution approximately 100 times higher than possible previously. We obtained new functional and mechanistic insight into the process of MOMP: We were able to determine the kinetics of pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane from the initiation phase of cytochrome-c-GFP redistribution, and showed differential pore formation kinetics in response to intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli (staurosporine, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)). We also detected that the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization frequently proceeded as a wave through the cytosol, and that the frequency of wave occurrence in response to TRAIL was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase CK2. Computational analysis by a partial differential equation model suggested that the spread of permeabilization signals could sufficiently be explained by diffusion-adsorption velocities of locally generated permeabilization inducers. Taken together, our study yielded the first comprehensive analysis of clonal cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis execution and allowed to visualize and explain the dynamics of MOMP in cells undergoing apoptosis.},

Confocal FLIM systems based on time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) methods provide high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, but suffer from poor signal to noise ratios (SNR) that complicate quantitative analysis. We extend a global analysis method, originally developed for single frequency domain FLIM data, with a new filtering method optimized for FRET-FLIM data and apply it to TCSPC data. With this approach, the fluorescent lifetimes and relative concentrations of free and interacting molecules can be reliably estimated, even if the SNR is low. The required calibration values of the impulse response function are directly estimated from the data, eliminating the need for reference samples. The proposed method is efficient and robust, and can be routinely applied to analyze FRET-FLIM data acquired in intact cells.},

We demonstrate that, once initiated, the activation of caspase-3 is a very rapid process, taking 5 min or less to reach completion. Furthermore, this process occurs almost simultaneously with a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These events occur just prior to the characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrate that, once initiated, the commitment of cells to apoptosis is a remarkably rapid event when visualized at the single cell level.},

abstract ={We report here the striking anisotropy of fluorescence exhibited by crystals of native green fluorescence protein (GFP). The crystals were generated by water dialysis of highly purified GFP obtained from the jellyfish Aequorea. We find that the fluorescence becomes six times brighter when the excitation, or emission, beam is polarized parallel (compared with perpendicular) to the crystal long axis. Thus, the major dipoles of the fluorophores must be oriented very nearly parallel to the crystal long axis. Observed in a polarizing microscope between parallel polars instead of either a polarizer or analyzer alone, the fluorescence polarization ratio rises to an unexpectedly high value of about 30:1, nearly the product of the fluorescence excitation and emission ratios, suggesting a sensitive method for measuring fluorophore orientations, even of a single fluorophore molecule. We have derived equations that accurately describe the relative fluorescence intensities of crystals oriented in various directions, with the polarizer and analyzer arranged in different configurations. The equations yield relative absorption and fluorescence coefficients for the four transition dipoles involved. Finally, we propose a model in which the elongated crystal is made of GFP molecules that are tilted 60° to align the fluorophores parallel to the crystal long axis. The unit layer in the model may well correspond to the arrangement of functional GFP molecules, to which resonant energy is efficiently transmitted from Ca2+-activated aequorin, in the jellyfish photophores.},

The diffusional mobilities of mammalian Golgi membrane proteins fused with green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria were measured in living HeLa cells with the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique. The diffusion coefficients ranged from 3 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second to 5 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second, with greater than 90 percent of the chimeric proteins mobile. Extensive lateral diffusion of the chimeric proteins occurred between Golgi stacks. Thus, the chimeras diffuse rapidly and freely in Golgi membranes, which suggests that Golgi targeting and retention of these molecules does not depend on protein immobilization.},

abstract ={No methods proposed thus far have the capability to measure overall molecular flow in the nucleus of living cells. Here, we apply the pair correlation function analysis (pCF) to measure molecular anisotropic diffusion in the interphase nucleus of live cells. In the pCF method, we cross-correlate fluctuations at several distances and locations within the nucleus, enabling us to define migration paths and barriers to diffusion. We use monomeric EGFP as a prototypical inert molecule and measure flow in and between different nuclear environments. Our results suggest that there are two disconnect molecular flows throughout the nucleus associated with high and low DNA density regions. We show that different density regions of DNA form a networked channel that allows EGFP to diffuse freely throughout, however with restricted ability to traverse the channel. We also observe rare and sudden bursts of molecules traveling across DNA density regions with characteristic time of ≈300 ms, suggesting intrinsic localized change in chromatin structure. This is a unique in vivo demonstration of the intricate chromatin network showing channel directed diffusion of an inert molecule with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = "We have investigated spatial variations of the diffusion behavior of the green fluorescent protein mutant \{EGFP\} (F64L/S65T) and of the EGFP-β-galactosidase fusion protein in living cells with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy device, in connection with a precision x-y translation stage, provides submicron spatial resolution and a detection volume smaller than a femtoliter. The fluorescence fluctuations in cell lines expressing \{EGFP\} are caused by molecular diffusion as well as a possible internal and a pH-dependent external protonation process of the \{EGFP\} chromophore. The latter processes result in two apparent nonfluorescent states that have to be taken into account when evaluating the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data. The diffusional contribution deviates from ideal behavior and depends on the position in the cell. The fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data can either be evaluated as a two component model with one fraction of the molecules undergoing free Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient approximately five times smaller than in aqueous solution, and another fraction diffusing one or two orders of magnitude slower. This latter component is especially noticeable in the nuclei. Alternatively, we can fit the data to an anomalous diffusion model where the time dependence of the diffusion serves as a measure for the degree of obstruction, which is large especially in nuclei. Possible mechanisms for this long tail behavior include corralling, immobile obstacles, and binding with a broad distribution of binding affinities. The results are consistent with recent numerical models of the chromosome territory structure in the cell nucleus. "

This technique measures the number density, diffusion coefficient, and velocity of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in a cell membrane imaged on a confocal, two-photon, or total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. In contrast to r-space correlation techniques, we show kICS can recover accurate dynamics even in the presence of complex fluorophore photobleaching and/or â€œblinkingâ€. Furthermore, these quantities can be calculated without nonlinear curve fitting, or any knowledge of the beam radius of the exciting laser. The number densities calculated by kICS are less sensitive to spatial inhomogeneity of the fluorophore distribution than densities measured using image correlation spectroscopy. We use simulations as a proof-of-principle to show that number densities and transport coefficients can be extracted using this technique. We present calibration measurements with fluorescent microspheres imaged on a confocal microscope, which recover Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficients, and flow velocities that agree with single particle tracking measurements. We also show the application of kICS to measurements of the transport dynamics of Î±5-integrin/enhanced green fluorescent protein constructs in a transfected CHO cell imaged on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope using charge-coupled device area detection."

abstract ={The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ERK1/2 is a crucial effector linking extracellular stimuli to cellular responses: upon phosphorylation ERK [also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase P42/P44 (MAPK)] concentrates in the nucleus where it activates specific programs of gene expression. Notwithstanding the importance of this process, little is known about the modalities, time course and regulation of ERK exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm in living cells. We visualized the dynamic of nuclear translocation by expressing low levels (<150 nM) of fluorescently tagged ERK2 in living fibroblasts. Time-lapse imaging demonstrated that nuclear concentration can change bidirectionally with a time constant of a few minutes. The increase of nuclear concentration requires continuous MEK (also known as MAPK kinase) activity upstream of ERK and is rapidly reduced by the operation of phosphatases. We measured quantitatively the speed of ERK2 shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm and determined that shuttling accelerated after ERK activation, becoming fast enough not to be rate-limiting for translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that ERK2 did not diffuse freely in the nucleus and that diffusion was further impeded after phosphorylation, suggesting the formation of complexes of low mobility. These results show that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of ERK2 and its mobility are dynamically regulated in living cells.},

ABSTRACT={Multicellular organisms rely on intercellular communication to regulate important cellular processes critical to life. To further our understanding of those processes there is a need to scrutinize dynamical signaling events and their functions in both cells and organisms. Here, we report a method and provide MATLAB code that analyzes time-lapse microscopy recordings to identify and characterize network structures within large cell populations, such as interconnected neurons. The approach is demonstrated using intracellular calcium (Ca2+) recordings in neural progenitors and cardiac myocytes, but could be applied to a wide variety of biosensors employed in diverse cell types and organisms. In this method, network structures are analyzed by applying cross-correlation signal processing and graph theory to single-cell recordings. The goal of the analysis is to determine if the single cell activity constitutes a network of interconnected cells and to decipher the properties of this network. The method can be applied in many fields of biology in which biosensors are used to monitor signaling events in living cells. Analyzing intercellular communication in cell ensembles can reveal essential network structures that provide important biological insights.}}

abstract = {We extend the in vitro principle of co-immunoprecipitation to quantify dynamic protein interactions in living cells. Using a multiresolution implementation of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to achieve maximal temporal resolution, we monitored the interactions of endogenous bait proteins, recruited by quantum dots, with fluorescently tagged prey. With this approach, we analyzed the rapid physiological regulation of protein kinase A.},
